Game notes (11/26) meetings

- Needs a wrapper

- What are you doing to drive
- How are you structuring play between people?
- What are you trying to go for?
- 


No Output (No main board showing favorite words, what you said, what you spelled)

Is this competitive or collaborative?

Make it crazy dirty?

---------------------------------------------------------
Why stick to 2 four letter words?

Think Cards against Humanity

(Probably lose a lot by making it a WW game)

Where can you get this published to?

( WW MOBILE )

4Play Saga? 

Compare results?


Let's aim for mobile

Answer questions you feel least safe about:

1.) Is typing on mobile fun?

- YES

2.) How social should it be?

3.) How dirty should it be?
- CRAZY DIRTY

4.) Keep it silly?
- Probably

5.) Sentences
- Use words instead of letters
(I vote for this one)

Word games are dry, spice it up

Always think about the answer you're trying to drive

4play

Don't need to do the code, necessarily
